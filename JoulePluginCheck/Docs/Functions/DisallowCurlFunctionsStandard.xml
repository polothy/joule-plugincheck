<documentation title="Disallow the use of cURL">
  <standard>
    <![CDATA[
    Moodle comes with its own classes for accessing resources via cURL. These should be used in preference to using cURL directly, as it allows optimisations
    to be implemented in one place only. For example limiting timeouts to meet page generation time (PGT) goals, or accessing resources via proxy servers.
